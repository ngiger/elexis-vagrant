# From https://github.com/crayfishx/hiera-gpg
# Hiera is often used by configuration management systems such as Puppet with all the configuration 
# stored in a VCS. Often you want to store sensitive information such as database root passwords in the 
# same place as the rest of your configuration so Puppet can read it. 
# hiera-gpg allows you to place your YAML in a gpg encoded file which can be read by Hiera on the command line 
# or via Puppet on any machine that has a valid secret key.
